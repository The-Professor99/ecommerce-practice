# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page solution

Took this practise to help me gauge how far gone i've been from front end web development as i've had to focus more on school and other things. Just getting back and I hope, little by little, I'll get back to track in no time.

If you happen to come through here, please drop any form of suggestion/advice you may have. They will be well appreciated.

It sha did turn out that i am farther gone than i had imagined. Hopefully, subsequent works will get better than this. 

This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
